Main Project Site:  http://openvulab.ca
User Manual:        http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Open+Virtual+Usability+Lab
Public Project Demo: http://vulab.yorku.ca


Required Knowledge
------------------

	* Basic FTP Knowledge (Uploading Files)
	* Basic Website Knowledge (what is a subdirectory, am I uploading into the root directory?)
	* Basic File Editing Knowledge (ability to open a .php file and edit plain text settings)
	* Basic Database Experience (Ability to import a .sql file into an existing database, what are database
	  credentials?)
	* Basic Server Administration Knowledge (Ability to install package)


Required Server Packages
------------------------
	
	* PHP 5+
	* MySQL 4+
	* Mencoder (Installation of this is explained below under "Additional Server Setup")


Setting Up Web Interface
------------------------

1. Upload All Files
	* Upload the contents of vulab-0.5.zip into the home directory for your website, this is usually public_html/
	  or httpdocs/, in this document we will assume you are using public_html as your home directory, and reference
	  paths to that.
	  
	* Your file structure should like something like the following:
	  (still assuming your using public_html as your home directory for your website)
	  	
	  	public_html/admin/
		public_html/index.php
		public_html/config.live.php
		etc....
		
	* NOTE: there are options for uploading into a sub-folder of your root directory but this is currently in
			beta testing! Use at your own risk.
	
2. Configure Database
	* Open public_html/admin/config.live.php
	
	* The first options you will see are for "database configuration", fill in all the information listed. (database
	  name, database user, database password)
	  
	* NOTE: Those curious people out there will see the file: public_html/admin/config.localhost.php, which is intended
			to be used if your installing openVULab on a local server (like, http://vulab.localhost), this config and
			feature of openVULab is in beta, and is not reccomended for the non-developer vulab expert - its risky business
			and mostly untested.
	
3. Import Database Schema
	* import the file public_html/database.sql into your mysql database
	NOTE: this can be done with phpMyAdmin, but this step's background knowledge is part of the required knowledge for this guide.
	
4. Create First (Admin) User
	* Browse to: http://yourdomain.com/admin/signup.php
	* Fill out the information for the admin user
	* BE SURE TO SELECT 'RESEARCHER' AS YOUR ACCOUNT TYPE
	* You will now be emailed your username and password but you can log in right away.
	* You are now setup with an admin account!
	
	NOTE: The first user is automatically the admin user so don't loose this account info or let it get stolen or taken by the social engineers in your network.
	
	
Additional Server Setup
-----------------------

openVULab requires mencoder (which is part of the MPlayer package) and if you are not comfortable with this please contact your server administrator.
